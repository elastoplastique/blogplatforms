### [Medium](https://medium.com)
Medium is ideal for writers who want to join a built-in community of readers and prioritize content distribution. If getting your writing seen by a wider audience is a core goal, Medium's existing readership is a big advantage.

### [Blogger](https://www.blogger.com/)
Blogger is one of the simplest and most budget-friendly blogging solutions. It's perfect for personal bloggers and beginners who want to start sharing their thoughts without any technical overhead or upfront costs.

### [Tumblr](https://www.tumblr.com)

### [Ghost](https://ghost.org)
Ghost exists as both an open-source platform (like WordPress.org) and a hosted service. It strikes a nice balance between simplicity and features, making it popular with individual bloggers and publications who value a clean writing experience and membership options.

### [WordPress.org](https://wordpress.org)
WordPress.org is the self-hosted version of WordPress, giving you unparalleled control over your website's functionality and design. This suits developers, power users, and businesses who need maximum flexibility and freedom to customize. Keep in mind, self-hosting requires a bit more technical know-how.


### [Publii](https://getpublii.com)
Publii is a static website generator geared towards users comfortable with a bit of technical setup and those who want a fast, secure blog. Static sites are less prone to hacking, making them appealing if security is a primary concern.

### [Joomla](https://www.joomla.org)
Joomla, like WordPress, is a powerful open-source content management system. It caters to medium to large organizations, developers, and those needing intricate website structures. While capable as a blogging platform, its complexity might be overkill for solely blogging purposes.
